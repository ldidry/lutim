# Lutim

## What Lutim means?
It means Let's Upload That Image.

## What does it do?
It stores images and allows you to see them, download them or share them on social networks. From version 0.5, the gif images can be displayed as animated gifs in Twitter, but you need an HTTPS server (Twitter requires that. Lutim detects if you have a HTTPS server and displays a static image twitter card if you don't);

Images are indefinitely stored unless you request that they will be deleted at first view or after 24 hours / one week / one month / one year.

## Wiki

The official wiki contains all you need to know about Lutim (installation, API, etc.). Go to <https://framagit.org/luc/lutim/wikis/home> or clone it:

```
git clone https://framagit.org/luc/lutim.wiki.git
```

## Encryption

Lutim does encryption on the server if asked to, but does not store the key.

The encryption is done on the server since Lutim is made to be usable even without javascript. If you want to add client-side encryption for javascript-enabled browsers, patches are welcome.

## Internationalization

Lutim comes with English, French and Spanish languages. It will choose the language to display from the browser's settings.
