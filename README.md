##Dependencies
* Carton : Perl dependencies manager, it will get what you need, so don't bother for dependencies (but you can read the file `cpanfile` if you want).

```shell
sudo cpan Carton
```

or

```shell
sudo apt-get install carton
```

##Installation
After installing Carton :
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ldidry/lutim.git
cd lutim
carton install
cp lutim.conf.template lutim.conf
vi lutim.conf
```

##Configuration
* hypnotoad: listen to listen to, user and group which runs hypnotoad ;
* contact: write something which make people able to contact you (contact form URL, email address, whatever) ;
* secrets: an array of random string. Used by Mojolicious for encrypting session cookies.
* piwik\_img: the Piwik image provides you records of visits without javascript (better privacy than js and cookies) ;
* length: length of the random string part of image's URL (default is 8) ;
* provis\_step: LUTIm provisions random strings for image's URL per pack of `provis_step` (default is 5) ;
* provisioning: number of random strings to provision (default is 100) ;
* hosted\_by: if someone hosts your LUTIm instance, you can add some HTML (a logo for example) to make it appear on index page ;
* tweet\_card\_via: a Twitter account which will appear on Twitter cards ;
* max\_file\_size: well, this is explicit (default is 10Mio = 10485760 octets) ;
* https: 1 if you want to provide secure images URLs (default is 0) ;
* stats\_day\_num: when you generate statistics with `script/lutim cron stats`, you will have stats for the last `stats_day_num` days (default is 365) ;
* keep\_ip\_during: when you delete IP addresses of image's senders with `script/lutim cron cleanbdd`, the IP addresses of images older than `keep_ip_during` days will be deleted (default is 365) ;
* broadcast\_message: put some string (not HTML) here and this message will be displayed on all LUTIm pages (not in JSON responses) ;
* allowed\_domains: array of authorized domains for API calls. Example: `['http://1.example.com', 'http://2.example.com']`. If you want to authorize everyone to use the API: `['*']`.

##Usage
```
carton exec hypnotoad script/lutim
```

##Update
```
git pull
carton install
carton exec hypnotoad script/lutim
```

Yup, that's all (Mojolicious magic), it will listen at "http://127.0.0.1:8080".

For more options (interfaces, user, etc.), change the configuration in `lutim.conf` (have a look at http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/Server/Hypnotoad#SETTINGS for the available options).

##Reverse proxy
You can use a reverse proxy like Nginx or Varnish (or Apache with the mod\_proxy module). The web is full of tutos.

Here's a valid *Varnish* configuration:
```
backend lutim {
    .host = "127.0.0.1";
    .port = "8080";
}
sub vcl_recv {
    if (req.restarts == 0) {
        set req.http.X-Forwarded-For = client.ip;
    }
    if (req.http.host == "lut.im") {
        set req.backend = lutim;
        return(pass);
    }
}
```

##Cron jobs
LUTIm have commands which can be used in cron jobs.

To see what commands are available:
```shell
carton exec script/lutim cron
```

###Statistics
To generate statistics which can be viewed at the address `/stats` (we need to reload hypnotoad after the stats generation):
```shell
carton exec script/lutim cron stats && carton exec hypnotoad script/lutim
```

###Delete IP adresses from database
To automatically delete the IP addresses of image's senders after a configurable delay:
```shell
carton exec script/lutim cron cleanbdd
```

###Watch the size of the files directory
To execute an action when the files directory is heavier than `max_total_size`.
The available actions are `warn` and `stop-upload`:
* `warn` prints a message on the standard out (which is normally mailed to you by `cron`) ;
* `stop-upload` prints a message on the standard out and creates the `stop-upload` file which prevents uploading and put a warn on LUTIm interface ;
* **DANGEROUS OPTION!!!** `delete` prints a message on the standard out and delete older images until the files directory goes under quota.

If the files directory go under quota, the `stop-upload` file is deleted. If you want to manually prevents uploading, create a file named `stop-upload.manual`.

```shell
carton exec script/lutim cron watch
```

##Broadcast message
Set a string in the `broadcast_message` option of `lutim.conf` and reload the server with:
```shell
carton exec hypnotoad script/lutim
```

It may take a few reloads of page before the message is displayed.

##API
You can add images by using the API. Here's the parameters of the `POST` request to `/` adress:.
* format: json
    MANDATORY if you want to get a json response, otherwise it will send a web page
* file: the image file
    MANDATORY
* delete-day: number of days you want the image to stay
    OPTIONAL if 0, it will be available undefinitely
* first-view: 1
    OPTIONAL if not 0, the image will be deleted at first view


Exemple with curl:
```shell
curl -F "format=json" -F "file=@/tmp/snap0001.jpg" http://lut.im
```

You can allow people to use your instance of LUTIm from other domains.
Add the allowed domains as an array in the `allowed_domains` conf option. Put '`[*]`' if you want to allow all domains.

##Shutter integration
See where Shutter (<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shutter_%28software%29>) keeps its plugins on your computer.
On my computer, it's in `/usr/share/shutter/resources/system/upload_plugins/upload`.

Then:
```
sudo cp utilities/Shutter.pm /usr/share/shutter/resources/system/upload_plugins/upload/Lutim.pm
```

And restart Shutter if it was running.

Of course, this plugin is configured for the official instance of LUTIm (<http://lut.im>), feel free to edit it for your own instance.

##Internationalization
LUTIm comes with English and French languages. It will choose the language to display from the browser's settings.

If you want to add more languages, for example German:
```shell
cd lib/I18N
cp en.pm de.pm
vim de.pm
```

There's just a few sentences, so it will be quick to translate. Please consider to send me you language file in order to help the other users :smile:.

##Others projects dependancies
LUTIm is written in Perl with the [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us) framework, uses the [Twitter bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) framework to look not too ugly, [JQuery](http://jquery.com) and [JQuery File Uploader](https://github.com/danielm/uploader/) (slightly modified) to add some modernity, [RaphaÃ«l](http://raphaeljs.com/) and [SimpleGraph](http://benaskins.github.io/simplegraph/) for stats graphs.
